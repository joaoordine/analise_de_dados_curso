# Final Project 
## ** Prediction of Alternative Open Reading Frames (Alt-ORFs) in a model breast cancer cell line (MCF7) **
"Transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms diversify the proteome beyond gene number while maintaining a sequence relationship between original and altered proteins. A new mechanism breaks this paradigm, generating novel proteins by translating alternative open reading frames  (Alt-ORFs) within canonical host mRNAs." Using bioinformatic pipelines to predict Alt-ORFs within a genome can be helpful to proteomics, allowing the identification of novel proteins within the same proteomic data using simply the MS database. Hereinafter are the scripts used to process genomic data from public databases (WGS) from a widely used breast cancer cell line, namely MCF7 and in the prediction of Alt-ORFs within this genome.
